A raw image is acquired which has to be processed. It can be expressed in form of pixels as stated above. The aim of this step is to extract information which is suitableforcomputing. 
### 2.) Processing and Enhancing it: 
The image is converted into digital form by using a digitizer which samples and quantizes the input signals. The rate of sampling should behigh for good resolution andhighquantizationlevelforhumanperceptionofdifferentshadesusingdifferentusinggray-scale
