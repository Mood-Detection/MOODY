# HOW OUR APP IS WORKING
### 1.) Scanning the image:
A raw image is acquired which has to be processed. It can be expressed in form of pixels as stated above. The aim of this step is to extract information which is suitableforcomputing. 
### 2.) Processing and Enhancing it: 
The image is converted into digital form by using a digitizer which samples and quantizes the input signals. The rate of sampling should behigh for good resolution andhighquantizationlevelforhumanperceptionofdifferentshadesusingdifferentusinggray-scale 
### 3.)Result:
The obtained result describes the property of the image and further classifies the image.
### 4.) FoodSelection:
After the mood is predicted the food corresponding to the recognized mood will show the menu which food is suitable to his/her mood. And after or he/she can cook the food or order it from restaurant. The objective of this paper is to develop a system  which can analyze the image and predict the expression of the person.
